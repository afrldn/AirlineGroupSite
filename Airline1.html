			<h2 id="part1">Overview & Structure</h2>

			American Airlines had a somewhat different layout than Delta, but were still efficient in what they were offering to their customers. Even though they used fewer colors as opposed to Delta, their offerings were clearly written and millions of people visit and book flights with this airline. 
			<h2 id="part2"> Positive Features</h2>
				<h3>Price Calculation</h3>
				Whenever booking the page will show the price of each individual flight to help the consumer.

				<h3>Round Trip Flights Low Cost</h3>
				Whenever searching for flights, some options allow return flights to be only a few additional dollars or entirely free.
			<h2 id="part3"> Features to Work on</h2>
				<h3>Search Location</h3>
				The search location for bookings is at the bottom of the homepage on the top of the fold. This cuts off some information and makes it hard to see right away
				<h3>First Class Information is Hard to Find</h3>
		<p>The information on what First Class benefits can make for users is very difficult to locate from the homepage.</p>
		<h3>Lack of Instruction or Information</h3>
		<p>Some pages and offers, such as the Avis discount, come with little explanation of how to earn the discount and how to apply it to trips.</p>
