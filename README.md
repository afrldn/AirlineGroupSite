# AirlineGroupSite

This site was a part of the group assignment for IS 301 - E-Commerce. The assignment was to write a paper comparing different websites in an industry and display it though a website of our own.  We were instructed to use basic HTML for the site, but I took the lead in making the site appear a bit better using CSS
